<h1>MyChain is a blockchain made with JAVA.</h1>

<p>
A blockchain is a chain/list of blocks.Each block in the blockchain will contain data, its own digital fingerprint, also the fingerprint of previous block so as to maintain integrity.

The fingerprint is also known as the Hash Value.
A block contains 2 Hash values its own and the previous block's, the hash value is calculated with the data and cryptographic algorithms like SHA256, so any change in the value will lead to inconsistency in the hash values leading to the blockchain being invalid.
